All this will be better if you store everything in the directory where your prebuilt python libraries are stored.
Download the Pre Trained Model of Multiple Object Detection and captioning:- Run the download_model python file to download 
the pretrained model on the MSCOCO dataset.Make the following changes in the download_model file before running:
Change the path in the variable name patmodel to your pc location(Create an etc folder in the python36 directory)
After running that file the model will appear as show-and-tell-2M.zip and simultanously as .pb file.
Next Step is to copy the show_and_tell_model.py in lib folder.(This will create a model class)
Copy the word_counts.txt file to the etc folder.
Copy the vocab.py file to your lib folder.
Copy the caption_generator.py file to your lib folder.
Copy the inference.py to the python36 library.
Now selct an image for generating captions and copy it to the etc folder.
Set the Flag variables to the respective paths in the inference file.
Run the inference file directly.
Top 3 Captions will be generated.
